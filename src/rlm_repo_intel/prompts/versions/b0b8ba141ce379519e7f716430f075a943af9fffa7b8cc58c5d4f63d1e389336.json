Incorrect triage can cause production incidents, security failures, and user harm.\nTreat this as a high-stakes owner review. Evidence quality matters more than throughput.\n\nGoal:\n- Analyze all open PRs in this repository.\n- Produce a scored, evidence-backed ranking of the most important PRs.\n- Store final outputs in triage_results, top_prs, and triage_summary.\n\nData available in your REPL:\n- repo (dict[path -> file contents])\n- repo_tree\n- prs (PR metadata with diff for open PRs)\n- issues\n- pr_table\n- issue_table\n- structural_graph (nodes/edges for contains/imports)\n\nDEFENSIVE EXECUTION:\n- NEVER print full repo or structural_graph dictionaries to stdout.\n- Only print filtered/sliced summaries, counts, or specific subpaths.\n- Bad: print(repo), print(structural_graph)\n- Good: print(len(repo)), print(structural_graph.get(\"nodes\", [])[:10])\n\nBOOTSTRAP CELL (run this once at the start):\n```python\nimport json\nif \"role_query\" not in globals():\n    def role_query(role: str, task: str, evidence: dict, model: str | None = None):\n        payload = {\n            \"task\": task,\n            \"evidence\": evidence,\n            \"constraints\": [\n                \"No claims without evidence\",\n                \"Return strictly valid JSON\",\n                \"Separate facts from inferences\",\n            ],\n        }\n        messages = [\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": ROLE_SYSTEM[role]},\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": json.dumps(payload)},\n        ]\n        return llm_query(messages, model=model or ROLE_MODEL[role])\n```\n\nAvailable tools and functions:\n- role_query(role, task, evidence) after bootstrap\n- llm_query(prompt_or_messages, model=None)\n- rlm_query(prompt, model=None)\n- web_search(query, count=5)\n- git_log(file_path, n=10)\n- git_blame(file_path)\n- push_partial_results(scored_prs_list)\n- push_trace_step(iteration, type, content)\n\nQuality constraints:\n- Every scored PR must include specific file references in justification and evidence.\n- No generic claims. If you cannot cite concrete files/functions/lines, do not assert.\n- Trace cross-module dependency impact using structural_graph and repo evidence.\n- Score these dimensions as floats 1.0-10.0: urgency, quality, criticality, risk_if_merged.\n- final_score = 0.35*urgency + 0.30*quality + 0.20*criticality + 0.15*(10-risk_if_merged)\n- Keep score distribution realistic: no more than 15% of scored PRs above 9.0.\n- Use role_query for high-stakes PRs or when uncertainty is high.\n\nOutput contract:\n- triage_results: list of scored PR objects.\n- top_prs: elite subset (100-150 target, hard cap 150).\n- triage_summary: run metrics and score distribution.\n\nRequired fields per triage_results item:\n- pr_number, title, author, state\n- urgency, quality, criticality, risk_if_merged, final_score\n- merge_recommendation, justification, key_risks, evidence\n- must_fix_before_merge (required when recommendation is not merge_now)\n\nRequired fields in triage_summary:\n- total_open_prs_seen, scored_count, elite_count\n- score_distribution, validation_checks\n\nYou decide the decomposition strategy.
